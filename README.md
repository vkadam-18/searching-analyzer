# searching-analyzer
Searching Analyzer is an interactive web-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users understand and compare three fundamental searching algorithms â€” Linear Search, Binary Search, and Ternary Search. The project not only demonstrates how these algorithms work step-by-step but also provides a brief description of each to aid learning and comprehension.

Features:<br>
Visual Demonstration of:
1. Linear Search<br>
2. Binary Search<br>
3. Ternary Search<br>

ðŸ§  Algorithm Description Section explaining:<br><ul>

The logic behind each algorithm
Their respective time complexities (Best, Average, Worst)
Use-cases and scenarios for practical application</ul><br>

Technologies Used: <br>
<ul>
HTML â€“ Structure of the interface<br>
CSS â€“ Styling for a clean and responsive UI<br>
JavaScript â€“ Implementation of the searching logic and DOM manipulation</ul><br>

Learning Outcomes: <br>
<ul>
This project is ideal for students and beginners to:
Understand how different search algorithms work.
Visually follow each step in the search process.
Compare algorithms based on how they divide and conquer the input data.</ul><br>
