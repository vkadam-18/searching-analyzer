# 🔍 Searching Analyzer

**Searching Analyzer** is an interactive web-based tool built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that helps users understand and compare three fundamental searching algorithms — **Linear Search**, **Binary Search**, and **Ternary Search**. The project not only demonstrates how these algorithms work step-by-step but also provides a brief description of each to aid learning and comprehension.
