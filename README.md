# searching-analyzer
Searching Analyzer is an interactive web-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users understand and compare three fundamental searching algorithms — Linear Search, Binary Search, and Ternary Search. The project not only demonstrates how these algorithms work step-by-step but also provides a brief description of each to aid learning and comprehension.

Features:
🎯 Visual Demonstration of:

Linear Search
Binary Search
Ternary Search

🧠 Algorithm Description Section explaining:

The logic behind each algorithm
Their respective time complexities (Best, Average, Worst)
Use-cases and scenarios for practical application

Technologies Used
HTML – Structure of the interface
CSS – Styling for a clean and responsive UI
JavaScript – Implementation of the searching logic and DOM manipulation

Learning Outcomes
This project is ideal for students and beginners to:
Understand how different search algorithms work.
Visually follow each step in the search process.
Compare algorithms based on how they divide and conquer the input data.
